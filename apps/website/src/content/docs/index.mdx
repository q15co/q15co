## Q15: Born from Real Experience

Q15 was founded by Adriaan, a developer who has been through the tech recruitment grind: intense interviews, challenging trial tasks, and tough salary negotiations. It’s this firsthand experience that shaped my unique approach to coaching, focusing on genuine support without the influence of external pressures.

### Certified Excellence
